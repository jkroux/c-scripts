Currently, we have a functioning exe that is provided
when one pulls the game. In terms of immediate use, every-
thing is set up from there. If one wishes to modify the game
they will need to install Unity 5. Then they will need
to open the c-scripts project in order to see everything in
the scene editor. From there, unity can do the rest.
If user is on a mac, they will need to make sure to use the
correct .exe
